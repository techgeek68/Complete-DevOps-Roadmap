## 14.1 Configuring SSH for Secure Remote Access

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for securely accessing and managing computers over a network. It was created to replace insecure protocols like Telnet and FTP by encrypting all data.

Features:
  - Security: Encrypts all communication to protect against attacks.
  - Authentication: Verifies users with passwords or, more securely, cryptographic keys.
  - Default Port: Operates on TCP port 22.
    
Process:
  - Open a terminal and run the command: ssh username@server_ip
  - Accept the server's host fingerprint on the first connection.
  - Authenticate with your password or SSH key.
  - Once connected, you can run commands on the remote machine.
  - Type exit to end the session.

**Prerequisites**
- You need two systems to connect between. You can:
  - Create two VMs: Web Server and Web Developer.
  - Example:
      vm1: DevOps-Linux-CLI (IPv4: 10.10.0.5)
      vm2: DevOps_Linux-GUI (IPv4: 10.10.0.6)
  - Or, simply create two users on one VM.

  

**A. Basic SSH Connection**

- **Linux/MacOS:** Pre-installed. Use `ssh` in terminal.
- **Windows:** OpenSSH (Windows 10/11), or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) for older versions.

**Basic SSH Connection:**
```bash
# Default port (22)
  ssh username@remote_host
            or
  ssh username@server_IP 

# Custom port
  ssh -p <port_number> username@remote_host 
              or
  ssh -p <port_number> username@server_IP
```

**SSH Server Configuration:**

`sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

```
# Change default port
Port 7070

PermitRootLogin no              # Disables root login via SSH for better security
PasswordAuthentication no       # Disables password-based login; only key-based auth allowed
PubkeyAuthentication yes        # Enables public key authentication
AllowUsers alice bob charlie    # Only allows SSH access for specified users
MaxAuthTries 3                  # Limits authentication attempts per connection to 3
ClientAliveInterval 300         # Sends a keepalive message every 300 seconds (5 minutes)
ClientAliveCountMax 2           # Disconnects client after 2 missed keepalive responses
```
<img width="730" height="474" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 7 23 15 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a6d0707-6068-41fc-9687-c4b799e956df" />


**SELinux & Firewall Configuration**

```bash
# Register custom SSH port with SELinux
sudo semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 7070

# Firewall rules
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=7070/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Reload SSH service
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

Connect:
    ```bash
    ssh -p 7070 user@remote_host_IP
    ```
    
<img width="712" height="289" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 7 29 12 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819c83b4-30cd-4590-aefd-cf36978debf7" />


**B. SSH Client Configuration (~/.ssh/config)**

The file ~/.ssh/config lets you define shortcuts and settings for SSH connections. Each Host block creates a nickname with custom parameters like hostname, port, user, key file, or proxy settings. It simplifies commands, instead of typing long SSH options, you can just run ssh <host-alias>.

Common directives:
  - HostName → actual server address
  - User → login username
  - Port → custom SSH port
  - IdentityFile → path to private key
  - ProxyJump → connect via a jump (bastion) host
  - LocalForward → create a local-to-remote tunnel

Below example shows how to use the SSH client configuration file (~/.ssh/config) to simplify and automate SSH connections, especially when you connect to multiple servers or use jump hosts.
```
Host webserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User admin
    Port 7070
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/webserver_key      #Connect to 192.168.1.100 as admin on port 7070 with key 

Host bastion
    HostName bastion.example.com
    User jumpuser
    Port 7070

Host internal-server                        #Connect to 10.0.1.50 via bastion jump host 
    HostName 10.0.1.50
    User admin
    ProxyJump bastion
    
Host db-tunnel                              #Creates a local SSH tunnel forwarding your local port 3306 to the remote database port 3306.
    HostName db.example.com
    LocalForward 3306 127.0.0.1:3306        #You can connect to your local port localhost:3306 as if you were directly connected to the remote DB server.
```

- Connect examples:
```bash
    ssh webserver
```
```bash
    ssh db-tunnel
```

**14.2 Key-Based Authentication**

- A secure login method using a matched pair of cryptographic keys instead of a password.
  - Private Key (kept secret on your machine), It proves your identity.
  - Public Key (placed on the server), It locks a challenge that only your private key can unlock.
    
- Authentication Handshake:
  - The client attempts to connect and informs the server of the public key to use.
  - The server generates a random message and encrypts it using the user's public key.
  - This encrypted message can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
  - The client decrypts the message with its private key and sends a response back to the server.
  - If the response is correct, the server grants access.

- It's More Secure Than Passwords:
  - Resistant to Brute-Force: Private keys are long, complex, and computationally infeasible to guess.
  - No Network Transmission of Secrets: The private key never leaves the client machine.
  - Can Be Further Secured: The private key can be protected with a passphrase.

- Generate SSH Keys:
```bash
# Modern (Recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -C "user@hostname" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# RSA (Legacy)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user@hostname" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Options:**
- -t <type> → Key type (ed25519 recommended; RSA for legacy)
- -b <bits> → Key size (for RSA/ECDSA, e.g., 4096)
- -f <filename> → File to save private key
- -C <comment> → Key comment/identifier
- -a <rounds> → KDF rounds for passphrase hashing
- -N <passphrase> → Set passphrase (can be empty
- -a <rounds> → KDF rounds for passphrase hashing
- -E <hash> → Fingerprint hash type (sha256 preferred)
- -R <host> → Remove host from known_hosts

- -o → Use new OpenSSH private key format
- -p → Change key passphrase
- -y → Print public key from private key
- -l → Show key fingerprint
- -i → Convert RFC4716 key to OpenSSH
- -e → Convert OpenSSH key to RFC4716
- -H → Hash known_hosts file
- -q → Quiet mode (suppress output in scripts)

Key generation example:
```
hostname
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100 -C cnode@localhost.localdomain -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
<img width="902" height="467" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 8 26 22 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3149336f-aca2-4de3-8add-866c5c6e68d7" />

**Keys Stored Location:**
- Private/Public:
  `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

**Secure Key Permissions:**
```
chmod 700 ~/.ssh                     # Owner can read/write/execute; secure the .ssh directory
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519           # Owner can read/write; private key must be kept secret
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub       # Owner read/write, others read; public key can be shared
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys      # Owner read/write, others read; allows SSH logins with listed keys
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config                # Owner read/write, others read; SSH client configuration file
```

**SSH Agent Management**

This is a process for securely storing and managing SSH private keys in memory so you don't have to repeatedly enter your passphrase. If your key has a passphrase (which it should), you’d normally type it every time. The SSH agent remembers it for the session, so you only type it once.

Advantages:
 - Single Sign-on: Enter your passphrase once and SSH multiple times without retyping it.
 - Secure Storage: Keeps private keys in protected memory instead of on disk.
 - Key Forwarding: Lets you use your local keys when connecting through intermediate servers.
 - Multiple Key Management: Easily manages different keys for different servers.

When to Use an SSH Agent:
* Daily SSH connections to multiple servers
* SSH in scripts or automated processes
* Working with Git repositories over SSH
* Using SSH jump hosts or bastion servers


```
# Start agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add key to agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# List loaded keys
ssh-add -l

# Remove all keys
ssh-add -D
```

**Deploy Public Key:**
```bash
# Automatic copy
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@remote_host

# Manual method
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh user@remote_host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

**Connect Using Key:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 username@remote_server_ip
```

Example:
<img width="1215" height="524" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 11 14 56 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1141de16-a9f2-4d8a-92c8-d2250d79be33" />


**Disable Password Authentication (on server):**
Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```
PasswordAuthentication no              # Disable password logins; only allow key-based authentication
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no     # Disable keyboard-interactive authentication (e.g., one-time codes)
UsePAM no                              # Disable Pluggable Authentication Modules; improves security when only keys are used
```

Reload SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

**14.3 File Transfers Over SSH**

File transfers over SSH leverage the Secure Shell protocol to securely move files between local and remote systems, or between two remote systems. This secure method encrypts the data during transit, protecting it from unauthorized access.

**A. SCP (Secure Copy)**

  - A command-line utility for copying files and directories between a local host and a remote host, or between two remote hosts.
    
```bash
# Local → Remote
scp file.txt user@remote:/path/

# Remote → Local  
scp user@remote:/path/file.txt ./

# Recursive directory copy
scp -r /local/dir/ user@remote:/path/

# Custom SSH port
scp -P 2222 file.txt user@remote:/path/

# Preserve file attributes
scp -p file.txt user@remote:/path/
```

Example:
  - Create a file in VM1: `vim index.html` and trasfer to it into VM2

<img width="619" height="67" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 11 54 24 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/595fe6b5-db0d-41c3-b694-94c1fa00cef7" />

<img width="732" height="286" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 11 55 20 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf535e0-e989-4128-911c-dd7205182db9" />

<img width="1249" height="288" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 11 57 51 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b48b98e0-2710-40ef-9492-407cf947a2ca" />


**B. RSync Over SSH**

- A utility for efficiently synchronizing files and directories, especially useful for large transfers or keeping data consistent between systems.
- Rsync can utilize SSH for secure transport.
- Advantages are only transfers changes, supports resume, compression, bandwidth control
  
```bash
# Basic sync
rsync -avz /local/dir/ user@remote:/remote/dir/

# Sync with delete (mirror)
rsync -avz --delete /local/dir/ user@remote:/remote/dir/

# Custom SSH port
rsync -avz -e "ssh -p 2222" /local/dir/ user@remote:/remote/dir/

# Partial transfers (resume)
rsync -avz --partial /large/file user@remote:/path/

# Bandwidth limiting
rsync -avz --bwlimit=1000 /local/ user@remote:/remote/
```
- **Flags:**
  - `-a`: Archive mode
  - `-v`: Verbose
  - `-z`: Compress
  - `-e`: Specify remote shell/port

Example:

<img width="752" height="609" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 12 19 39 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c350bf2-7944-4abc-b918-65bca747a644" />

<img width="493" height="241" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-04 at 12 19 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a89236b-2dfd-461d-889f-d30daba2f87f" />



**SSHFS (SSH Filesystem)**

 - A more feature-rich file transfer protocol built on top of SSH, offering capabilities beyond simple file copying, such as listing directories, creating/deleting files, and resuming interrupted transfers.
 - Typically accessed through an SFTP client (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP, or the sftp command-line utility).
 - Mount remote directories as local filesystems, So working with remote files as if they're local

```bash
# Mount remote directory
sshfs user@remote:/remote/path /local/mountpoint -p 2222

# Unmount
fusermount -u /local/mountpoint

# Persistent mount (/etc/fstab)
sshfs#user@remote:/path /local/mountpoint fuse.sshfs port=2222,defaults 0 0
```

Example:
 - Install sshfs package on both VMs
```
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install -y sshfs
```

 - Make sure SSH is working between VM1 → VM2
   - Test SSH login (port 2222):
     ```
     ssh -p 2222 centos@192.168.1.20
     ``` 
 
 - Create a folder on VM2 to share on VM2:
```
mkdir -p /home/centos/shared
echo "This file is from VM2" > /home/centos/shared/test.txt
```

 - Create local mount point on VM1 in VM1:
```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/vm2shared
sudo chown centos:centos /mnt/vm2shared
```

 - Mount remote directory using sshfs in VM1:
```
sshfs centos@192.168.1.20:/home/centos/shared /mnt/vm2shared -p 2222
```

 - Verify
```
ls /mnt/vm2shared
cat /mnt/vm2shared/test.txt
```

 - Umount when it's done
```
fusermount -u /mnt/vm2shared
```

 - Make it presistence
   `sudo vim /etc/fstab`
   `sshfs#centos@192.168.1.20:/home/centos/shared /mnt/vm2shared fuse.sshfs port=2222,defaults,_netdev 0 0
`
 - Verify
   ```
   sudo mount -a
   ls /mnt/vm2shared
   ```

Key Differences:
- SCP: Fast for one-time transfers
- RSync: Efficient for syncing and large datasets
- SSHFS: Convenient for ongoing file access

**14.4 Security and Hardening**

A. SSH Hardening

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```
#Disable Root Login:
  PermitRootLogin no
  
#Change Default Port:**
  Port 2222

#Limit Allowed Users:
  AllowUsers alice bob
```

**SSH Hardening Script**
```
#!/bin/bash
# ssh-hardening.sh

# Backup original config
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Apply security settings
cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config << EOF
Port 2222
Protocol 2
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AllowUsers alice bob
MaxAuthTries 3
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
LoginGraceTime 60
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no
PrintMotd no
IgnoreRhosts yes
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
HostbasedAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
AllowAgentForwarding no
EOF

# Reload SSH
systemctl reload sshd
echo "SSH hardening completed"
```

**Fail2Ban Configuration (anti-brute-force):**   

- Monitors logs and bans IPs with suspicious activity.

```
# Install
sudo apt install fail2ban  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install fail2ban  # RHEL/CentOS

# SSH jail configuration (/etc/fail2ban/jail.local)
[sshd]
enabled = true
port = 2222
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime = 3600
findtime = 600

# Start and enable
sudo systemctl enable --now fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```

---

**B. Firewall Configuration**

**Allow SSH (custom port):**

```bash
# UFW (Ubuntu)
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp
sudo ufw enable

# firewalld (RHEL/CentOS)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2222/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# iptables (Legacy)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

**Password Policy Enforcement**
```
# Install PAM module
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality    # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install libpwquality        # RHEL/CentOS

# Configure (/etc/security/pwquality.conf)
minlen = 12
minclass = 3
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
maxrepeat = 2
```

**Sudo Security**
```
# Edit sudoers safely
sudo visudo

# Example entries
# User with full access
alice ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# User with specific commands
bob ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx, /usr/bin/systemctl status nginx

# Group-based access
%admins ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Passwordless for specific commands
%backup ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/rsync

# Log all sudo commands
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
```

---



**Advanced/Enterprise Enhancements**

### A. Bastion Host / Jump Host Setup

- Use a dedicated bastion host as a secure entry point to private servers in multi-tier environments.
- Restrict SSH access to production/internal servers from outside only via the bastion.
- Example `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for bastion:
  ```
  AllowTcpForwarding yes
  PermitTunnel yes
  ```
- Use ProxyJump/ProxyCommand in `~/.ssh/config`:
  ```bash
  Host internal
    HostName 10.0.0.10
    User admin
    ProxyJump bastion-host
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ssh -J bastion-host internal
  ```
- Harden bastion: restrict IPs, enforce key-based auth, enable logging/auditing.

### B. Automated SSH Certificate Authorities (CA)

- Use OpenSSH CA to issue short-lived certificates for users/hosts.
- Benefits: central control, key rotation, short-lived credentials.
- Example to sign a user key:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca_key -I user -n username -V +1h ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```
- Add CA public key to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
  ```
  TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub
  ```
- Automate with Vault, Teleport, or AWS IAM SSH certificates.

### C. Cloud-Native SSH Session Auditing

- **AWS:** Use [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) for shell access with audit logs and no direct SSH port exposure.
- **Azure:** Use [Azure Bastion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) for secure, audited SSH/RDP.
- **GCP:** Use [IAP TCP Forwarding](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding) and OS Login for SSH session logging.

_Best Practice:_  
Prefer cloud-native session management for audit/compliance and no key management.

### D. Advanced PAM Modules for SSH Restriction

- Use PAM modules to restrict SSH sessions by time, IP, user, or MFA.
- Example for time-based restrictions:
  - Edit `/etc/security/time.conf`
- Example for multi-factor authentication:
  - Integrate [Google Authenticator PAM](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
    ```
    Add to `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:
    ```
    auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
    ```

_Best Practice:_  
Use PAM for granular SSH session controls, compliance, and MFA.

### E. Monitoring SSH Daemon with Prometheus Exporters

- Install [prometheus-sshd-exporter](https://github.com/caarlos0/prometheus-sshd-exporter) or similar.
- Exposes SSH login metrics (auth attempts, failures, active sessions).
- Example systemd service:
  ```bash
  [Unit]
  Description=Prometheus SSHD Exporter
  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sshd_exporter --listen-address=:9119
  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```
- Scrape with Prometheus, alert on anomalies in Grafana.

_Best Practice:_  
Integrate SSH metrics into central monitoring for security and operational insight.
