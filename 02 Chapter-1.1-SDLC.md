# Software Development Life Cycle

**What is SDLC?**
A systematic framework for planning, building, testing, deploying, and
maintaining software. It ensures the final product meets user requirements and
is free of defects.

**Key points**:

**Structured Process:**
‚Üí Like following a recipe to bake a cake (ingredients = code, steps = phases).

**Quality Assurance:**
‚Üí Ensures the software works as intended (e.g., a banking app must handle
transactions securely.

Example: Imagine building an e-commerce app:

- **Requirement**: The app should let people search for products, add them to
    a cart, and pay for them.
- **Design**: Sketch out how the app will look (UI) and plan how the product
    data will be stored (Database).
- **Coding**: Write the backend (using Python and Django) to handle things
    like products and orders. Use React to build the user interface.
- **Testing**: Make sure the payment system (like Coonect IPS, eSewa, or
    Khalti) works properly by testing different cases.
- **Deployment**: Put the app online using cloud services like AWS, Google
    Cloud or locally managed server.
- **Maintenance**: Fix problems, like when items in the cart disappear after
    logging out, and keep the app updated.


**Why SDLC?**

1. Helps with planning, scheduling, and estimating
    ‚ó¶ Breaks the project into phases with timelines
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       A team building a **Hospital Management System** might allocate two
       weeks for requirement gathering, four weeks for design, etc.
2. Defines standard steps for everyone to follow
    ‚ó¶ Everyone knows what to do next and how to do it.
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       All developers use **Git** to manage code versions and updates.
3. Tracks progress and keeps things under control
    ‚ó¶ Can be checked if the project is on time or falling behind.
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       A project manager checks if the login feature is finished before starting
       payment integration
4. Makes the plan clear to everyone involved
    ‚ó¶ Everyone - Clients, developers, testers ‚Äì knows the progress.
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       Stakeholders of a banking app see updates after each completed phase.
5. Speeds up development
    ‚ó¶ Clear steps mean less confusion and faster work
   
```
Example:
A food delivery app finishes faster because everyone follows the
same steps.
```
6. Improves client communication and trust
    ‚ó¶ Clients see progress regularly and can give feedback.
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       Showing a prototype of a food delivery app to the client every two
       weeks.
7. Reduces risks and avoids problems later
    ‚ó¶ Early testing catches critical bugs
    ‚ó¶ Example:
       A flight booking system is tested for high traffic to avoid crashes when
       People book tickets.

**SDLC Phases
Phase 1: Requirement Collection**

- Responsible teams: Product Manager, Business Analysts
- Understand/Gather what users need/want.
- Example:
    For a fitness app, requirements may include tracking steps, heart rate, and syncing with wearable devices.
- Tools: Jira (for tracking tasks and user stories), Confluence (for
    documentation requirements, meeting notes, and product decisions)

**Phase 2: Feasibility Study**

- Check if the project is viable.


- Example:
    Can a startup build a smart home app? Factors: Cost (NPR
    1M+), legal regulations, and technical expertise.
**Phase 3: Design**
- Responsible team: System architects, UI/UX Designers
- Create blueprints for how the system will work and look.
- Example:
‚ó¶ Designing a **ride-sharing app** :
‚ñ™ Architecture: Microservices Architecture, with separate services
like User Service, Payment Service, Ride Matching Service, etc.

```
‚ñ™ UI/UX: Mockups or wireframes for core user flows ‚Äì booking a
ride, viewing driver location, and tracking ride progress.
```
**Phase 4: Coding**

- Responsible team: Developers (Backend & Frontend)
- Translate designs and requirements into working software by writing
    code.
- Example:
    ‚ó¶ Backend: Python (e.g., using Flask or Django) to create RESTful APIs
    ‚ó¶ Frontend: React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface
       interface
    ‚ó¶ Database: SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for database and retrieval

**Phase 5: Testing**

- Responsible team: QA, Testers


- Ensure the software works correctly, reliably, and meets user
    expectations.
- Types:
    ‚ó¶ Unit Testing: Check individual components or functions in isolation.
       - Example:
          Verifying a login function returns correct results for
          valid/invalid credentials.

```
‚ó¶ Integration Testing: Test how different modules work together
```
- Example:
    Ensuring the payment gateway correctly processes
    transactions from the shopping cart.

```
‚ó¶ User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Real users test the application to
Confirm it meets their needs
```
- Example:
    Beta testing a game app before public release.
- **Tools** :
‚ó¶ Selenium
Automates browser-based tests for web apps.
‚ó¶ Postman
Used to test APIs by sending HTTP requests and verifying
responses.

**Phase 6: Deployment**

- Responsible team: System Administrators, DevOps engineers


- Release the application to a production environment where users can
    access it.
- Example:
    ‚ó¶ Deploying a **weather app** to the App Store/Google Play with CI/CD
       pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate build, test, and release
       processes.

**Phase 7: Maintenance**

- Responsible team: Support engineers, Maintenance team
- Keep the software up-to-date, reliable, and aligned with user needs over
    time.
- Types:
    ‚ó¶ Corrective: Fix bugs or defects.
       - Example: Resolving an app crash issue on iOS 15
    ‚ó¶ Adaptive: Modify software to work with changes in the environment.
       - Example: Updating compatibility for Android 14

```
‚ó¶ Perfective: Improve performance or enhance features.
```
- Example: Adding dark mode based on user feedback

**Traditional SDLC Models
I. Waterfall Model:**
‚ó¶ A simple, linear, and sequential development process
‚ó¶ Follows a top-down approach
‚ó¶ Each phase must be fully completed before moving to the next
‚ó¶ Begins with long planning and design phases
‚ó¶ After development, the software is tested and then deployed


```
‚ó¶ Each phase is reviewed upon completion to check progress and
feasibility
‚ó¶ Too rigid to adapt to changes, one development starts
‚ó¶ Does not support feedback or changes during the process
‚ó¶ This inflexibility led to the rise of more adaptive models like Agile
```
```
II. Agile Model:
‚ó¶ Focuses on iterative and incremental development
‚ó¶ The application is initially released with high-priority features in the
first iteration
‚ó¶ After release, end-user/customer feedback is collected
‚ó¶ Feedback is used to make improvements and add new features. The
updated application is released in the next iteration
‚ó¶ This cycle repeats until the desired software quality is achieved
‚ó¶ Encourages continuous interaction between development and testing
teams
‚ó¶ The entire project is broken into small, manageable builds
‚ó¶ Each build is delivered in iterations, typically lasting 1 to 3 weeks
```
**Examples:**
üöø **Waterfall Model ‚Äì E-commerce Website**

1. **Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
    - **Teams:** Business Analysts + Product Owners + Stakeholders
    - **Activities:**
       - Conduct user interviews (e.g., what filters shoppers need).
       - Benchmark competitors (e.g,. Daraz, local retailers).


- Produce a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
    covering:
       - User registration/login
       - Product catalog and filtering
       - Shopping cart and checkout
       - Payment methods (cards, wallets)
       - Order history and tracking
- Finalize scope and sign off.
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks
- **Deliverables:** Approved SRS, project plan, stakeholder sign-off
2. **System & UI Design**
- **Teams:** System Architects + UI/UX Designers + Database
Designers
- **Activities:**
- Define architecture: n-tier web architecture, tech stack (e.g.
React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL).
- Design Entity Relationship(ER) diagram for products, users,
orders, payments.
- Create wireframes (Basic sketches or layouts of a web/app)
and high-fidelity mockups (detailed design of pages, e.g.
adding colours, logos, images) for key pages.
- Specify non-functional requirements: scalability (e.g., auto-
scaling), security (PCI DSS compliance), performance (page
load ‚â§ 2 seconds).
Note: PCI DSS- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks
- **Deliverables:**
- Architectural design document


- Database schema
- UI mockups + style guide
- API specification
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
- **Teams:** Frontend Engineers + Backend Engineers + API
Developers
- **Activities:**
- Set up code repositories, CI pipelines.
- Frontend: build components (product grid, filter sidebar, cart
modal).
- Backend: implement REST APIs (products, cart, orders,
payments).
- Integrate payment gateway.
- Write unit tests (aiming for ‚â• 70 % coverage).
- **Timeline:** 10 weeks
- **Deliverables:**
- Functioning codebase in dev environment
- Unit-test reports
- Continuous integration build passing
4. **Integration & System Testing**
- **Teams:** QA Engineers + Test Automation Engineers
- **Activities:**
- Develop test plans and test cases (functional, regression,
security).
- Execute manual tests (e.g., checkout flow, edge cases like out-
of-stock).


- Run automated suites (e.g., Selenium for UI flows, Postman
    for APIs).
- Log defects; developers fix bugs in a separate ‚Äúbugfix‚Äù cycle.
- Perform load testing (e.g,. simulate 1,000 concurrent users).
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks
- **Deliverables:**
- Test reports (bug counts, severity)
- Signed-off release candidate build
5. **Deployment & Maintenance**
- **Teams:** DevOps Engineers + System Administrators + Support
Engineers
- **Activities:**
- Provision production environment (IaC with Terraform).
- Configure CI/CD pipeline to deploy to staging, then
production.
- Conduct smoke tests post-deploy.
- Provide user documentation and train support staff.
- Monitor live metrics (uptime, response times) and resolve
incidents (SLAs: 1 hr for critical).
- **Timeline:**
- Deployment: 1 week
- Maintenance: ongoing
- **Deliverables:** Live site, runbooks, support logs

üîç **Feedback & Change Control:**

- **When:** At phase-gate reviews (end of each phase) or post-launch


- **How:** Formal Change Request (CCR) process; each request is impact-
    assessed (time, cost)
- **Effect:** Late changes (e.g., ‚Äúadd wishlist‚Äù) go to future maintenance
    release (costly to retrofit)

**Challenges:**

- **Inflexibility:** Hard to pivot if market or requirements change mid-project
- **Risk of Late Discovery:** Usability issues or missing features only surface
    at Testing or after launch
- **High Rework Cost:** Even minor scope changes can require revisiting
    multiple phases

```
1. **Initial Backlog & Architecture Spike (Sprint 0)**
    - **Teams:** Cross-functional Scrum Team (Developers, QA, DevOps,
       UX) + Product Owner + Scrum Master
    - **Activities:**
       - Product Owner writes **user stories** (e.g., ‚ÄúAs a shopper, I want
          to filter products by size so I can find items that fit‚Äù).
       - Team estimates stories (story points) and sets up basic
          architecture (CI/CD, dev/test environments).
       - Create a minimal ‚ÄúDefinition of Done‚Äù and quality checklist.
    - **Timeline:** 2 weeks
    - **Deliverables:** Initial product backlog, architecture skeleton,
       environments ready
2. **Sprint Cycle (2-Week Iterations)**
    - **Sprint Planning (4 hrs):**


- Team selects highest-priority stories (e.g. login & product
    listing).
- Breaks stories into tasks (frontend, backend, test tasks).
- **Development & Testing (10 business days):**
- Pair programming & test-driven development.
- Continuous integration runs on every push; immediate
feedback on build/test status.
- **Daily Stand-up (15 min):** Synchronize progress and remove
blockers.
- **Sprint Review (2 hrs):**
- Demo working increment to stakeholders (e.g., live product
grid with pagination).
- Collect feedback (e.g,. request ‚Äúinfinite scroll‚Äù instead of
pagination).
- **Sprint Retrospective (1 hr):**
- Discuss what went well (CI speed, collaboration) and what to
improve (estimation accuracy).
- Agree on one or two process improvements for the next
sprint.
3. **Example Sprint Breakdown (First 3 Sprints)**
Sprin
The Core Stories Delivered Key Feedback & Updates
1 User login/logout, basic product catalog ‚ÄúAdd social login (Google/Facebook)‚Äù ‚Üí backlog

```
2 Shopping cart add/remove, product search + filtering ‚ÄúEnable coupon codes at checkout‚Äù ‚Üí backlog
```
```
3 Checkout flow, integration with Stripe, order history UI tweak: show order confirmation email link
```

4. **Continuous Delivery & Adaptation**
    - At the end of each sprint, a **potentially shippable** product
       Increment is ready for real-user testing (feature toggled off until
       fully polished).
    - New high-value stories (e.g., ‚ÄúWishlist,‚Äù ‚ÄúLive Chat Support‚Äù) can
       be added anytime to the product backlog and prioritized for the next
       sprint.
5. **Deployment & Operations**
    - Small, frequent releases (canary deploys) after every 2‚Äì3 sprints.
    - DevOps monitors metrics and rolls back immediately on critical
       issues.
    - Support team triages user tickets; high-priority fixes go into the
       sprint backlog.
üîç **Feedback & Change Handling**
- **When:** After every Sprint Review (every 2 weeks)
- **How:** Stakeholder feedback is directly fed into the backlog; no formal
Change the board needed
- **Effect:** High-priority changes can appear in the next sprint, keeping the
product aligned with evolving needs

**Benefits & Challenges**
- **Benefits:**
- Rapid value delivery (first basic shopping in 2 weeks).
- High adaptability to new market demands (e.g., seasonal
promotions).
- Early detection of usability issues.
- **Challenges:**
- Requires strong team discipline to avoid scope creep.
- Demands continuous stakeholder engagement.


- Needs robust automation (CI/CD, test suites) to maintain quality.

**Which to Choose?**

- **Waterfall** if your requirements are stable, budget/funding is fixed, and
    you need heavy documentation (e.g., compliance projects).
- **Agile** if you expect changing requirements, need fast time-to-market, and
    can engage stakeholders continuously.
