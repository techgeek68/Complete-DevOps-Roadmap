**Quoting and Escaping**:

 - **Double quotes (`"`)**: Allow variable and command expansion, but prevent most word splitting and globbing.
   Example:
   ```sh
   echo "Hello $name"      # Output: Hello World
   echo "This is \$name"   # Output: This is $name
   ```
   
 - **Single quotes (`'`)**: Everything inside is taken literally. No variable, command, or escape expansion.
   Example:
   ```sh
   echo 'Hello $name'      # Output: Hello
   echo 'It\'s fine'       # Output: It\'s fine (backslash is not special inside single quotes)
   ```
 
 - **Backslash (`\`)**: Escape special characters (space, dollar, quote, etc.) to prevent their usual meaning.
   ```sh
   echo Hello\ World       # Output: Hello World
   echo "Hello \"World\""  # Output: Hello "World"
   echo \$HOME             # Output: $HOME
   ```
